CSR: Thank you for calling Valiant Bank Customer Service. How can I assist you today?
Alex: Hi, I&apos;m having trouble logging into the My Money Centre app. It keeps saying my credentials are invalid.
CSR: I see. Can I have your name and account details to assist you further?
Alex: My name is Alex Johnson, and I recently received my credit card.
CSR: Thank you, Alex. It seems your account might be temporarily locked due to multiple unsuccessful login attempts. Did you receive a temporary password via email that you needed to concatenate with your birthday?
Alex: Oh, I didn&apos;t notice that instruction. I just tried using the password provided.
CSR: That&apos;s okay. Let&apos;s proceed with resetting your access. I&apos;ll guide you through it.
Alex: Okay, thank you.
CSR: First, please reset your password using the temporary one sent to your email. After that, concatenate it with your birthday as instructed.
Alex: Done. Now I&apos;m entering the concatenated password.
CSR: Perfect. You should be able to log in now.
Alex: It worked! I&apos;m in. Thank you so much for your help.
CSR: You&apos;re welcome, Alex. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
Alex: No, that should be all. Thanks again!
CSR: You&apos;re welcome. Have a great day, Alex!
Alex: You too. Goodbye!
CSR: Goodbye.
